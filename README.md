# Series00-Git-AntoineLescarboura
This repository is used to learn the basics of Git and GitHub by the method of "learning by doing".

I already had the occasion to use GitHub with teachers to recover some documents that theu wanted us to have. I also used it on a project with classmates to help us code an application (front-end and back-end).

Finally, I also used GitHub in a internship that I did 2 years ago where we were developping an application and there was a big amount of files and any error could destroy all the work that had been done so we needed to merge and check if there wasn't ant problems before sharing the code.
