# Series00-Git-AntoineLescarboura
This repository is used to learn the basics of Git and GitHub by the method of "learning by doing".

I already had the occasion to use GitHub with teachers to recover some documents that theu wanted us to have. I also used it on a project with classmates to help us code an application (front-end and back-end).

Finally, I also used GitHub in a internship that I did 2 years ago where we were developping an application and there was a big amount of files and any error could destroy all the work that had been done so we needed to merge and check if there wasn't ant problems before sharing the code.

I already now a good amount of Python R and Git but I'm really motivated to learn a lot more because I feel like these are the real tools for us to use in our future jobs.
Informatic is starting to take a big big part af data analysis, and even more in sports or in other sectors where good performances are  crucials (like health, finance, ...)

CONCLUSION:
Here we learned to modify a file in local before pushing it on the main branch (with pulling requests).
We also learned to add an image, that can be fromthe web or from our computer.

It took me about an hour to complete this homework.
